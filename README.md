# Parkinson Disease Prediction
This project dives deep into the misfolding and aggregation behavior of alpha-synuclein, a key protein associated with Parkinson’s Disease. By analyzing its 3D structure from PDB files, the model aims to distinguish between Parkinson’s-positive and negative cases, contributing toward research in early diagnosis and drug targeting.
✨ Key Features:
🧩 Used PDB files of alpha-synuclein and its variants as input
🔬 Extracted relevant structural features using Biopython
🤖 Trained a classification model to predict Parkinson’s-positive or -negative outcomes
🧠 Visualized 3D conformations using PyMOL and UCSF Chimera
🌐 Built a Flask-based web interface for users to upload PDB files and receive predictions
🛠 Tech Stack:
 Python | Biopython | Flask | PyMOL | UCSF Chimera | scikit-learn | NumPy | Pandas | HTML/CSS | VS Code
💡This project merges AI and molecular biology to explore impactful
